Title: Reframing Amae: Toward a Neurocognitive and Social Relational Paradigm in Psychiatry

Abstract: This paper reconsiders the clinical and cultural framing of amae, a concept often mythologized as uniquely Japanese, and historically marginalized or pathologized in Western psychiatric frameworks. Drawing on contemporary cultural psychology, neurocognitive research, and social psychiatry, we demonstrate that amae-like relationality is cross-culturally prevalent, neurobiologically validated, and therapeutically beneficial. We expose the symbolic violence embedded in dominant psychiatric paradigms that equate relational dependency with regression, and we advocate for the urgent integration of pluralistic ontologies and automated research frameworks that support co-regulatory and affectively intelligent models of care. We emphasize, at multiple junctures, the imperative to root out symbolic violence and to adopt paradigms aligned with relational, cognitive, and sociocultural realities.

1. Introduction Western psychiatric thought has long privileged autonomy, self-regulation, and intrapsychic integrity as indicators of mental health. Within this framework, culturally grounded relational dynamics such as amae have been misinterpreted as pathological dependencies. This paper critically reassesses such framings, leveraging interdisciplinary research to revalidate amae as a legitimate, cross-cultural, neurocognitively supported form of co-regulatory relationality.

2. Dismantling the Myth of Amae's Uniqueness

2.1 Cross-Cultural Empirical Evidence Research by Niiya et al. (2006) revealed that American participants, like their Japanese counterparts, exhibited and positively responded to amae-like relational requests. Similarly, University of Michigan studies have shown greater frequency of amae analogs among Americans in daily scenarios, contradicting the uniqueness thesis.

2.2 Amae in Romantic and Social Contexts Marshall et al. (2011) used daily diaries to analyze amae in Japanese romantic relationships, identifying strong correlations with trust-building and conflict reduction. These findings underscore amae as a mechanism for affective regulation rather than dependency pathology.

3. Neurocognitive Validity of Relational Models

3.1 Inter-brain Synchrony and Social Bonding Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated inter-brain synchrony during shared emotional and social experiences. Such synchrony, linked to vagal tone and mentalization capacities, supports the view of amae as a neurobiologically grounded co-regulatory process (Russell et al., 2018).

3.2 Attachment Neuroscience and Culture The Neuro-Anatomical Model of Attachment (NAMA) confirms that early attachment and social context sculpt neural patterns of relationality. ERP studies reveal that Japanese participants show greater neural sensitivity to relational cues, affirming cultural calibration of social cognition.

4. Symbolic Violence in Psychiatric Classification

4.1 Western Norms as Implicit Violence Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence elucidates how psychiatry, by universalizing autonomy-based norms, enacts epistemic and therapeutic harm. Relational subjectivities are invalidated and misclassified as immature or pathological.

4.2 Power Dynamics and Epistemological Erasure The erasure of amae in Western discourse is not merely an omission but a consequence of deeper epistemological power structures. The Enlightenment valorization of rational individualism, combined with colonial and imperial epistemologies, forged a psychiatric language intolerant of interdependence. This framework has been perpetuated through medical institutions, linguistic systems, and diagnostic regimes that encode independence and emotional containment as signs of health. The suppression of amae is thus a systemic result of power dynamics that privilege hegemonic masculinities, deny affective pluralism, and delegitimize relational forms of agency. Symbolic violence here manifests as a recursive loop—where affective behaviors outside dominant norms are rendered unintelligible, thereby excluding them from discourse and clinical validation.

5. Rooting Out Symbolic Violence: Toward a Paradigm Shift

5.1 Revising Diagnostic Frameworks We call for revising systems like DSM-5 and ICD-11 to incorporate relational diagnostics. This includes developing scales for co-regulation, relational synchrony, and cultural adaptability.

5.2 Ontological and Computational Tools Using ontological engineering (e.g., OWL-based extensions to HiTOP), psychiatric concepts like amae can be encoded and cross-validated across cultures. Automated tools can mine linguistic, behavioral, and clinical data to restructure classifications.

5.3 Reparative Methodologies Therapeutic models should integrate relational neuroscience and cultural competence training. Cross-cultural dyadic interventions that emphasize amae-like dynamics have shown promise in enhancing emotional resilience.

6. Conclusion: A Call for Transformative Integration This paper repositions amae as a neurocognitive, cultural, and affective phenomenon essential for human relationality. By exposing and rooting out symbolic violence twice—once in epistemology and again in practice—we clear space for a pluriversal psychiatry that validates relational subjectivities. The future of mental health lies in embracing interdependence, codifying social-affective mechanisms, and fostering automated and ethical research paradigms.
