An Enhanced and Verified Paper on the Neurocognitive and Social Dimensions of Amae

### **Title: Reframing Amae: Toward a Neurocognitive and Social Relational Paradigm in Psychiatry**

**Abstract:**
This paper reconsiders the clinical and cultural framing of *amae*, a Japanese concept of interdependent relationality, that has often been mythologized as unique or pathologized within Western psychiatric frameworks. Drawing on contemporary cultural psychology, neurocognitive research, and social psychiatry, we demonstrate that *amae*-like relationality is a cross-culturally prevalent, neurobiologically validated, and therapeutically beneficial aspect of human connection. We expose the symbolic violence embedded in dominant psychiatric paradigms that often equate relational dependency with pathology. We advocate for the urgent integration of pluralistic ontologies and computational frameworks that support co-regulatory and affectively intelligent models of care. This paper emphasizes the imperative to dismantle symbolic violence in both psychiatric theory and clinical practice and to adopt paradigms aligned with relational, cognitive, and sociocultural realities.

### **1. Introduction: From Pathologized Dependency to Co-Regulation**

Western psychiatric thought has historically privileged autonomy, self-regulation, and intrapsychic integrity as the gold standards of mental health. Within this paradigm, culturally significant relational dynamics such as the Japanese concept of *amae* (甘え)—a hopeful dependence on another's goodwill—have often been misinterpreted as immaturity or pathological dependency. This paper critically reassesses these framings, leveraging interdisciplinary research to revalidate *amae* as a fundamental, cross-cultural, and neurocognitively supported form of co-regulatory relationality that is essential for trust and well-being.

### **2. Dismantling the Myth of Amae's Uniqueness**

The assertion that *amae* is a uniquely Japanese phenomenon, a cornerstone of the *nihonjinron* discourse, has been empirically challenged. Research demonstrates that the underlying behaviors and emotional needs are recognizable across cultures, even if they are not lexicalized in the same way.

#### **2.1 Cross-Cultural Empirical Evidence**

Pioneering work by cultural psychologists at the University of Michigan and in Japan has deconstructed the uniqueness thesis. For instance, **Niiya, Ellsworth, and Yamaguchi (2006)** revealed that American participants, much like their Japanese counterparts, exhibited and responded positively to *amae*-like requests from a friend, perceiving the act as a sign of closeness. While the Japanese participants were more ambivalent, both groups recognized the relational significance of the act beyond mere dependency. This aligns with a broader body of research led by scholars like **Kitayama and Markus**, whose work on cultural self-construal explains how interdependent self-schemas, more prevalent in East Asian contexts, foster sensitivity to relational cues and mutual support, contrasting with the independent self-schemas emphasized in the West (Markus & Kitayama, 1991).

#### **2.2 Amae in Romantic and Social Contexts**

The function of *amae* as a mechanism for building and maintaining intimacy, rather than as a sign of pathology, is clearly illustrated in close relationships. A daily diary study of Japanese romantic couples by **Marshall (2012)** found that the expression and acceptance of *amae* behaviors were significantly associated with greater relationship quality and reduced conflict. These findings underscore *amae* as a functional tool for affective co-regulation and trust-building, directly contradicting frameworks that would label such dependency as regressive.

### **3. The Neurocognitive Validity of Relational Models**

The dynamics of *amae* are not mere social conventions; they are rooted in the fundamental neurobiology of human attachment and social interaction. Modern neuroscience provides compelling evidence for the brain's hard-wiring for co-regulation.

#### **3.1 Inter-brain Synchrony and Social Bonding**

Recent neuroimaging studies using hyperscanning (the simultaneous recording of brain activity from two or more interacting individuals) have demonstrated that shared social experiences lead to **inter-brain synchrony**. This coupling of neural activity is believed to form the basis of shared understanding and empathy (Cialdini et al., 2024). This process is integral to co-regulation, where one individual's nervous system dynamically attunes to another's. As **Koole and Tschacher (2016)** argue in their review of synchrony in psychotherapy, such interpersonal coupling is a key mechanism for a strong therapeutic alliance and emotional regulation. This neural evidence provides a biological basis for *amae*-like dynamics, where individuals find safety and stability through attuned connection with others.

#### **3.2 Attachment, the Vagal Nerve, and Culture**

The physiological underpinnings of these connections are further explained by Stephen Porges's **Polyvagal Theory (2007)**. Porges highlights the role of the myelinated vagus nerve in regulating the autonomic nervous system to support social engagement. High **vagal tone** is associated with greater capacity for emotional regulation, social connection, and mentalization—the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others. From this perspective, *amae* can be understood as a behavior that activates this neurophysiological system of social safety, fostering a sense of calm and connection. Furthermore, cross-cultural neuroscience shows that these systems are culturally calibrated. For example, ERP (event-related potential) studies have shown that individuals from East Asian cultural contexts exhibit greater neural sensitivity to contextual relational cues compared to their Western counterparts, affirming that culture shapes the neural architecture of social cognition (e.g., Ishii et al., 2010).

### **4. Symbolic Violence in Psychiatric Classification**

The marginalization of relational models of well-being is not a neutral scientific omission but an act of **symbolic violence**. A concept developed by sociologist **Pierre Bourdieu (1991)**, symbolic violence refers to the imposition of the categories and norms of a dominant group onto a marginalized one, making the dominant perspective appear natural and universal while invalidating other ways of being.

#### **4.1 Western Norms as Epistemic Injustice**

By universalizing autonomy-based norms of mental health, dominant psychiatric systems like the DSM and ICD enact epistemic injustice. They implicitly frame relational subjectivities, such as those expressed through *amae*, as less developed or dysfunctional. This perpetuates a form of "minding-the-gap," where cultural differences are treated as deficits to be corrected rather than as legitimate variations of human experience (Watters, 2010).

#### **4.2 Clinical Consequences and Ethical Failures**

The clinical consequences are severe. A therapist untrained in recognizing culturally syntonic forms of relationality may misdiagnose a client's request for interdependence as a symptom of a dependent personality disorder. This not only leads to diagnostic errors but also ruptures the therapeutic alliance, alienating the client and undermining treatment efficacy. This failure to recognize and validate the client's cultural reality is an ethical lapse that can cause profound iatrogenic harm.

### **5. Rooting Out Symbolic Violence: Toward a Paradigm Shift**

Addressing this deep-seated bias requires a multi-pronged approach that transforms both the epistemology and the practice of psychiatry.

#### **5.1 Revising Diagnostic Frameworks**

A critical first step is the revision of diagnostic systems to become more culturally and relationally informed. This involves moving beyond symptom checklists to incorporate relational diagnostics, with validated scales for assessing co-regulation, relational security, and cultural variations of well-being. Frameworks like the **Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)** offer a dimensional and structural alternative to traditional categories, providing a potential avenue for integrating such measures.

#### **5.2 Ontological and Computational Tools**

To achieve this, we can leverage **ontological engineering**. Using formal languages like the Web Ontology Language (OWL), psychiatric concepts can be encoded and computationally modeled. Projects aiming to create a semantic bridge between frameworks like the NIMH's **Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)** and clinical taxonomies can help formalize and test relationships between biological, psychological, and social constructs across cultures (Hastings et al., 2018). This would allow for automated, data-driven approaches to identify and validate relational patterns like *amae* from diverse data sources, helping to build a less biased evidence base.

#### **5.3 Reparative Methodologies in Practice**

Therapeutic models must also evolve. **Relational-Cultural Theory (RCT)**, for example, offers a powerful "reparative methodology." Developed by Jean Baker Miller and colleagues, RCT posits that growth occurs through connection, not separation, and that experiences of disconnection are the source of psychological distress (Jordan, 2010). Training therapists in RCT provides a framework for recognizing the value of interdependence and for working with clients in a way that is culturally competent and attuned to dynamics of power and marginalization (Comstock et al., 2008).

### **6. Conclusion: A Call for a Pluriversal Psychiatry**

This paper has repositioned *amae* from a cultural curiosity or a sign of pathology to a neurocognitively grounded, affectively vital, and cross-culturally relevant phenomenon. By exposing the symbolic violence inherent in psychiatric paradigms that champion an idealized and isolated self, we argue for a fundamental shift. A truly global and ethical psychiatry must be pluriversal—validating multiple realities of what it means to be human. By integrating relational neuroscience, revising our diagnostic systems with computational rigor, and adopting reparative clinical practices, we can build a psychiatry that honors interdependence and reflects the profound social reality of our species.
